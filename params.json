That is what this project is dedicated to.  Teaching a computer to make money for you in the stock market.  The reason for this is to increase my net worth. \r\n\r\n### What\r\nTechnical analysis of the stock market has been around since the Dutch markets in the 17th century according to Wikipedia.  It is a method of predicting the future prices of securities by studying past market behavior.  Specifically technical analysis includes finding patterns in past price and volume data.  These patterns are then applied to the stock market in real-time.  I would like to teach a computer how to find patterns in historical stock market data and then look for those patterns developing in real-time in the stock market.  This is a very interesting problem because technician have use this same technique for hundreds of years to profit.  If a human can recognize these patterns in charts, a computer can also be trained to do so.  The difference is that a computer can do it more efficiently and react to the patterns much faster than any human could, maximizing profits.\r\n\r\n### Resluts\r\n#### Example of Error Reduction\r\n![error_good](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10660367/11338320/a0750f52-91b0-11e5-9ac7-3e69fc420e60.PNG)\r\n\r\n#### My Error Reduction\r\n![error_chart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10660367/11338325/a7c3728a-91b0-11e5-97cf-edb80f06e906.PNG)\r\n\r\n#### My Error Changing\r\n![error_changing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10660367/11338321/a63ec478-91b0-11e5-9a5d-699bc98e1f5f.PNG)\r\n\r\n#### My Error Settling\r\n![errors_end](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10660367/11338330/aa6b163c-91b0-11e5-9e56-396330c3a011.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
